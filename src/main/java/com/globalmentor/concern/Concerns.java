/**
 * Provides access to some concern that may be global or local to some section of the program.
 * <p>
 * A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concern_%28computer_science%29>concern</a> is some implementation of {@link Concern} and represents some concern
 * such as logging or internationalization. A concern of a specific type can be associated with some thread group, which allows local concerns to be set. A
 * global concern can also be set, which which serves as a fallback for that concern type when no thread group-specific concern is defined. No fallback need be
 * implemented if a thread group-specific concern is always provided to requesting threads.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A concern can be made local by registering it with a thread group that is {@link Concerned}, such as {@link ConcernRegistryThreadGroup} , and creating a
 * {@link Thread} using one of the thread's constructors that specify a {@link ThreadGroup}. All threads that run in the thread group will have access to the
 * concern by calling {@link Concerns#getConcern(Class)}, specifying the class of the {@link Concern} implementation. The concern registered with the
 * {@link Concerned} thread group will be returned. A concern can thus be restricted to specific areas of the program.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If no thread group is found that implements the concern type, a global default concern is searched for by using {@link Concerns#getDefaultConcern(Class)}. If
 * no local or global concern of the requested type is found, a {@link ConcernNotFoundException} is thrown.
 * </p>
